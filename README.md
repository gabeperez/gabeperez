- **Coffee & Matcha Lover:** I’m passionate about discovering new coffee shops and getting fuled to build things for [gimme.coffee](https://gimme.coffee).
- **Languages:** Fluent in English and Spanish, I’m currently learning Japanese, with a goal to pass the **N3 Japanese Language Proficiency Test**.
- **Tinkering & Tech:** Whether it’s developing apps without coding, using SwiftUI for macOS projects, or exploring tools like Sublime and Xcode, I love experimenting with technology.
- **Family Life:** A proud parent of two adorable kids: a 4-year-old daughter (born October 24, 2020) and a baby boy (born September 2, 2024).
